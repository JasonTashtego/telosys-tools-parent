VERSION MANAGEMENT :

It's possible to change the current version in the "parent POM" 
and to propagate that change onto any child modules as necessary.

See http://www.mojohaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/set-mojo.html

To SET A NEW VERSION  in all the "pom.xml" files :
  Use "versions:set" with "-DnewVersion=X.X.X"
  A "pom.xml.versionsBackup" file is created (it contains the original version) 
  Under Eclipse : run the maven-version.launch  

  
Other commands
 - "versions:revert" : restores the "pom.xml" files from the "pom.xml.versionsBackup" files.
 - "versions:commit" : removes the "pom.xml.versionsBackup" files.
